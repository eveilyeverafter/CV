# CV and resume

Here you'll find the source code for my CV and resume LaTeX files.

The CV style was adapted from http://jblevins.org/projects/cv-template/

To build:

```
pdflatex cv-TylerHether.tex
```

The resume was modified from an Overleaf template (see https://www.overleaf.com/)

Building is similar as the CV:

```
pdflatex resume.tex
```
